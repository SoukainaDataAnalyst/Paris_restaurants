It's the perfect place to eat out of Paris for less than 25 euros per person (drink included) it's just 25 min from the Eiffel tower and when walking you get an amazing view of the city lights  \n",

Little did we realize that lunch also came with a large bowl of super fresh salad greens with incredible dressing, AND miso soup!  All for around $20 each.

Our server was kind, smiling, and welcomed us. He offered suggestions and checked in on how we liked the food and if we needed anything. He offered the perfect balance of attention and discretion. I wish I could remember his name. As for the food, it was the best sushi I have had in Canada, which is surprising given that Edmonton is not near the ocean.  All the usual choices are there which are done with highest quality. The spicy tuna is a plain Jane looking dish that has such great flavor- the tempura bits taste just fried, the quality of tuna is wonderful, as is the consistency of the rice. We also had chicken teriyaki- lean well cut thigh meat  under stir fried fresh veggies (cabbage, onions, peppers ) with what tasted like a house made teriyaki sauce. We did have to order rice on the side as everything is a la carte. The cocktails are amazing, I had a lychee margarita. We will be returning to try the unique dishes Japonais has to offer.\n",

      "text: Very nice & pretty restaurant with excellent food. The steak (La cote de bouef), escargot, onion soup were delicious. Love the blue cheese & bell pepper sauce. We also ordered the halibut which was creamy & tender.  We tried the daily special, gnocchi with truffle which was so good. The bouillabaisse was very rich & creamy but $62 was very expensive for this dish. The Syrah went well with the steak but overall price is a bit on the high side, be prepared to spend more than $100 per person for a good meal with 1 glass of wine.  The desserts were heavenly. The creme brûlée came with a light touch of lavender aroma, the tarte au chocolat was rich, smooth & very chocolaty which was not too sweet to my liking. Les Crepe de Suzette & Clafoutis were our favourites. One tip is to come on Wednesday to enjoy the free flow escargot at $20+ per person. Service was good & staff were friendly.

He sat a couple down after ourselves on a table next to us, he then proceeded to bring them the menus to the couple who sat down after us and take their order, only after that did we even get a menu. The waiter then took our drinks order then our food order, sadly when our starters arrived one of them was wrong and we had to wait 10 minutes for the right one to appear. At no point in the meal were we asked if we wanted anything else to drink or whether we were happy with our food. We got the impression that they were trying to turn round tables quickly, our waiter didn’t seem to be engaged at all which was a real disappointment.

      "I have never left a trip advisor review before , but the treatment at this place was disgraceful. I was there visiting from the UK with my two daughters and granddaughter. the bill (cheque) came to  $312 -twice the price of my local Lebanese restaurant where the food is much better-but nevertheless I rounded the bill up to $ 350. Once I had paid some smarmy woman came up and announced to the table \"was everything ok ? it's just that you left a very low tip\". The tip was twice what would be expected in Europe and was  in any event not deserved. If she was really enquiring about the standard of the service she could have asked me personally discreetly.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I replied that I did not appreciate someone coming to my table telling me in front of my family that I had left a low tip.  An American friend has now told me that a 20% tip is what is expected as the staff are paid by their tips. Pathetic. inevitably my daughters were extremely embarrassed -not least by how much I had paid for their meals-and the whole situation was awful. The place was packed selling overpriced average food and the owners were making a fortune. If they want a tip here's one \" Pay your staff a descent living wage so that any gratuities are a bonus!\"\n",

      "text: The food was delicuous and our waiter was really nice and welcoming but then the thing happened. I wanted to surprise my table and pay for the whole table so I excused myself and found another waiter and asked if I could pay now. He was annoyed from the start but then he told me the amount and I handed him the money, he then asked if I really wanted the money back, found it strange but thought nothing of it. Then I just happily went back to the table. About 10 minutes later my annoyed waiter came and said \"I was NOT gonna say anything BUT your tip was to little\". I was so surprised and I just said that I did not understand. He then stated again that I had not tipped enough. I said I had not realized, he never offered me any option for tipping when I was paying so I stupidly asumed that he had included the tip. We tried repeatly to explain that this was a misunderstanding and without hesitation added to the tip. He was still annoyed and gave me his best evil eye. But first of all we where clearly tourists, and where we come from you never tip. Second of all I do not believe it is mandatory to tip. Third he never once asked if I would like to add tips. We went home with a good story being told of by a New York waiter. So to sum up, delicuous food and a rude waiter. The whole NYC experience :) Just remember to tip, and for the love of god be generous!\n",

However why this has been scored poorly is because the 3 pizzas arrived ant then my 6 year old daughter (who was very hungry by this point of the evening) had to wait another 10-15 minutes for her meal, which was very dry pasta, with very little tomato sauce and a handful of ham thrown on at the last minute. They had obviously forgot and had to throw something together! We did receive a 10 Euro refund for my daughter's meal but this was given very begrudgingly and the waiting staff after we complained gave evil looks. Overall highly unsatisfactory and would recommend alternatives nearby unless you want disappointed children such as Casa Lusitana or Terraza.\n",

      "text: The Hotel de Glace (Ice Hotel) is the only one available in North America.  I wanted to go here ever since seeing a commercial about staying in a hotel made of ice and now I have.  Everyone should try this experience at least one time.  In addition to your room at the Hotel de Glace you also get a normal hotel room (for showers, changing, suitcase storage, etc.).  They will instruct you, in a mandatory training session, on how best to enjoy the experience.  I will not list the instructions here because instructions can change.  What I will say is that if you follow their instructions you will not be cold whilst sleeping in the ice hotel.  Every room is a piece of art, all sculpted out of ice and snow.  It is absolutely an amazing experience and I would not object to going back.  The ice hotel has a bar, a slide, lounge area, and they also have a wedding chapel.  So cool!!!!  Do not miss this unique hotel, only available for a short amount of time each winter.  I want to say thank you to the owner, designers, sculptors, artists, and maintenance crews who make this work of art possible.  Merci, c'est tres beau!!\n",

So many people have these expectations that it should be like a normal regular hotel experience, it’s an Ice Hotel and will never be like a normal hotel.\n",

      "My wife and I recently stayed in suite 23 on March 9, 2022. The suite cost $1005.00 for the one night. With this you get a huge room with fire  🔥 place and PRIVATE sauna and hot tub (spa). Some might say it’s a lot of money for. Hotel room. But It’s an incredible deal if you actually take a look at what you’re getting. People spend $1000 to stay at a fancy hotel, get a good seat at a hockey game or concert. Spending this amount of money is most definitely worth it. For the $1005.00 you are not only getting a suite in the Hotel de Glace, you are also getting a suite at the Hotel Val Cartier, which will act as a your back up room, change room etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Hotel de Glace keeps the hallway lights on during the night, there is no secured doors for any of the guest rooms, the doors are  just blocked off by curtains. To me all this is ok, during the night Hotel de Glace staff were walking around throughout the hotel. \n",
      "\n",
      "All the staff I met were incredibly nice, and thankful we were there. You could tell they we’re proud they worked at the ice hotel given the uniqueness of this place. Many of the staff were happy to take photos, help with starting our fire, lifting the hot tub cover off for us, putting a chair in place to help accommodate my disability, making drink suggestions at the ice bar, and explaining how best to use the sleeping bag while in the ice hotel. Many of the staff were able to speak English and I never felt negatively judged for not being able to speak French. I will always remember what one of the staff members said after I said thanks for taking our photo, he said “no problem our guests are like royalty here”\n",

It’s important to remember that if you’re following your vehicles navigation system it will guide you to the previous location of Hotel de Glace.

      "text: I went to great lengths to get here for a day visit ($30) -- without a car, it is quite a pain to get to from Quebec City. A taxi will run you $70. If you go during a non-peak time (e.g. weekday morning), you will be able to find an Uber for $50 (but you must taxi back to the city, as they have no Ubers in Valcartier). Normally, there is a shuttle bus package via Vieux Quebec Tours but it is was cancelled due to COVID (but re-opens today, Feb. 5, 2022). \n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, I am so glad I came here!! What a unique and special experience. Your day ticket allows you to spend as much time as you like wandering around the hotel rooms, bars, and chapel. There is even a little ice slide that I definitely tried a few times. There is currently no guided tour but that was fine with me, as there are information panels throughout and a short audio introduction you can listen to on your phone by scanning the QR code. From reading old reviews, it sounds like the day tours used to include a drink at the bar, so that was the only thing I missed out on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Every year the hotel is constructed from scratch and tons of hours day and night go into creating the structure and then adding all the unique snow and ice sculptures and decorations. I loved that there is a room where you can see some of the equipment they use to create the hotel. They posted on instagram Jan. 30 that all phases of the building were completed, so I was lucky to visit after that. I guess you can still go earlier but certain parts will be under construction. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's a photographer's dream here and really magnificent to see what can be done with snow and ice. When you need to warm up, you can go to the Hotel Valcartier and the adjoining building where there are restaurants, shops, washrooms, and a spa. Note that some are closed right now due to COVID. \n",
      "\n",
      "You are required to wear a face mask inside the ice hotel. I would recommend bringing an extra face mask to change into afterwards, because after wandering around in the cold wearing an N95 mask, your breath will likely create humidity inside the mask that will freeze. So it's not very comfortable after you go indoors, when your mask defrosts and gets damp. \n",

In the email it said a full refund.  I called the hotel to cancel because if we were going there we wanted the full experience.  I asked if we could change the date she said no.  She said she could give me a gift card for what I have spent for a fee of $57, and that I was lucky that the fee is usually $200 plus tax for rescheduling or getting a credit to use a further date.  I told her that I got this email and that when I talked to the lady that booked me I asked about cancellation (seeing as everything keeps shutting down for covid) and she told me that you could cancel for full refund the girl on the phone told me that her supervisor had booked me and that I was a liar and she wouldn't have said that.  I asked to talk to the supervisor and the supervisor told me yes full refund if they close the hotel which she didn't say that when I asked her.

Foie gras and pulpo de galego came with so much salt on it that we had to scrape it with the cutleries napkins, but even after that was impossible to eat (and we like some salt on these dishes normally). So we left most of food and asked to not add any salt to dorada fish and steak of beef that we ordered to continue. Fish came extremely overcooked that was hard to chew or swallow so we had only tasted it and left it as garnishing whole potatoes were completely raw, sadly had to leave such a good fish, what a waste thanks to bad chef. Steak was the worst steak in geneva since 8 years, had 2 bites and left it too as it was impossible to chew due to extremely dry meat tasted like it has been cooked twice or frozen. Garnishing was fried eggplants that were soaked with cheap bitter oil and was disgusting and french fries that were cooked frozen and heated again from their consistency and taste. So we spend money and left very hungry as it was impossible to eat any dish out of 4. Will never come back terrible food. But even more... we did jot want to discuss with the waitress and just leave but she insisted 3 times asking why we didnt eat the food, so eventually we said we didnt like it. Her response was very unexpected as she started to attack us by lifting the food with hands in the plates and shouting at us that we dont understand what is good food. It felt bad as all the people were looking at us and as we felt very disrespected and rudely attacked for not our fault we would never recommend to anyone this place. \n",

I've been to many fine dining restaurants and firstly, the decor is excellent with well spaced tables and comfortable seating, and the ambient music isn't too loud. Our waiter, Shane, was excellent, friendly and personable, and very knowledgeable as was the somelier. We had the 3 course set menu. The appetizer of soba noodles was delicious, as was the beef carpaccio. The scallops were done perfectly, and the beef tenderloin was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The balance of additional flavors was incredibly tasty, and the wine pairings were perfectly chosen. The lemon custard dessert was divine and ended the meal perfectly. Overall, it was one of the best meals we have ever had. Couldn't negatively critique a thing. Highly recommend a visit here.\n",

      "text: Having visited other markets I was very keen to visit Mercato Centrale. What a disappointment! The produce stalls are ok but nothing special.The food options on the ground floor were very basic while the upstairs food court is just a tourist trap with bad service and little quality. We ordered some seafood from one vendor which took 50 mins to get to us ,while she continued to keep taking orders.I hate to think how long other people had to wait. I waited in line for 15mins to get 2 drinks .Our seafood was over cooked and cold.The place is grubby and if you want to sit down ,you have to wait for someone to leave and then put up with their dirty plates.It was a total waste of time.With so many good food options in Florence don't waste your time here.We stayed 100 m from here and never ventured back.Maybe, go and have a look but to me, it just isn't worth it.\n",

      "text: This isn't your Rock 'N Roll McDonald's anymore. And, frankly, as an 80-year-old retiree, I like what I see at 600 North Clark Street in Chicago's River North neighborhood. It still is McDonald's flagship location in Chicago and the signature Big Mac still is the most iconic fast-food sandwich ever invented. Remember the way it was? The original 1983 building and the first design of the rebuilt 2005 structure held a rock 'n roll exhibit in a building adjacent to the restaurant and a small upstairs McDonald's museum display. In 2017, a redesign of the restaurant and adjacent building jettisoned the rock 'n roll theme that highlighted the busiest McDonald's in the United States. In 2018, the current futuristic new building opened with 19,000 square feet on a single floor, 5,000 fewer square feet than the previous two-story structure. But it is open 24/7 and still occupies an entire city block bounded by West Ontario to the north, West Ohio to the south, North La Salle to the west and North Clark to the east. It is part of McDonald's \"Experience of the Future\" campaign, a way the company is redefining its brand across the globe with a green concept that features over 1,000 solar panels, apple trees, arugula, broccoli and kale and native grasses on the green roof. The futuristic building is a mixture of glass and steel, a dining room with a 27-foot ceiling, two 60-foot arches, a coffee bar designed to compete with Starbucks, two stories of windows, 10 cash registers and a plaza of 70 trees surrounding the restaurant. There are fewer parking spaces but more room for bicycles. Call if pedestrian friendly. Meanwhile, nobody has messed with the menu. Who could re-make a Big Mac? Who would try? In case you have forgotten, Big Mac was introduced in 1967, 10 years after Burger King's Whopper, but it is the gold standard of the fast-food industry. It contains two 100 percent pure beef patties and Big Mac's special sauce sandwiched between a sesame seed bun topped with pickles, shredded lettuce, chopped onions and American cheese. I also favor the quarter-pounder with cheese, a quarter-pound of fresh beef topped with slivered onions, tangy pickles and two slices of melted American cheese on a sesame seed bun. And the filet-o-fish sandwich with melted American cheese and topped with creamy McDonald's tartar sauce on a soft, steamed bun. Meanwhile, my wife prefers the simple but classic cheeseburger with a slab of pure beef topped with pickles, chopped onions, ketchup, mustard and a slice of American cheese. With McDonald's world famous fries made with premium potatoes such as Russet Burbank and Shepody. Wash it all down with chocolate and strawberry milk shakes. While some things change, other things don't.\n",

It was pouring rain and we had forgot to bring the resorts umbrellas and towels, but no need to worry they had an umbrella for each of us and towels too. We arrived at Chichén Itzá before the crowds and Juan took us on a tour. He was knowledgeable and answered all our questions. We had time to explore on our own and then we were off to see Ik Kil. We took pictures and walked down to the platform. We then had lunch at a wonderful buffet which was included. Then off again to the secret cenote.  There was some miscommunication so the operators were not there but they promptly came back. It is a newly discovered cenote, down a unpaved road in the middle of the rain forest. We were a little apprehensive because it was so rustic. They lit it up and we walked down into the most beautiful place I have ever seen. We swam, took pictures and explored in an underground paradise. We never felt rushed through the tours and were very well taken care of.

      "\n",
      " The position in resort is good but, (I have never written a negative review before)  i think they need to know our feed back to improve. Position is good for ski in ski out and the rooms are basic but OK. Most important lots of hot water and a warm room. However we were half board and only ate in the restaurant on the first two nights. The food was seriously bad. We decided to go out of the hotel for dinner at our expense every  night. There are a few local restaurants to choose from all of which were well run and fun. There for we ended up paying for dinner twice on 5 nights. \n",

      "The rooms are not cleaned every day as a matter of course, the boot room smells like an extension of the hotel sewers and I would say the the hotel needs some older more experienced staff to kick it in to shape.

      "text: This hotel is a real gem. The ski in ski out location is unbeatable with the boot room accessible directly from the piste. Rooms are surprisingly large and very comfortable with spacious bathrooms and tea and coffee making facilities. The spa is a real asset to soothe those aching legs after a long day skiing. We found the enormous jacuzzi a great place to socialise and also enjoyed the sauna, steam batch and swimming pool. The bar area is large with lots of different seating areas- so always somewhere to sit and chat with other guests. The karaoke (not normally our thing) on our final night was brilliant fun. The ski area is very extensive and well connected- one of the best we have experienced. But the best thing about this hotel is the staff. We have never come across such genuinely friendly hotel staff before- each and everyone made us feel so welcome and really enhanced our stay. Book Le Montana and you won’t regret it. \n",

Lounge area including pool tables were a welcome addition and hotel staff provided some entertainment. Televisions had sky which my sons welcomed so they could watch the football! Afternoon tea and cake was a pleasant surprise. Only downsides were food got a bit repetitive. Boot room layout could be improved it was too cramped. Also having the sledging outside meant some nights we were woken up by drunk teenagers sledging. Not sure what hotel can do about that, perhaps turn off outside lights ?

      "text: We made reservations at this restaurant as our friends were eating here a few weeks before us, so after they had dined and reported back that they had a good meal, we kept our reservations. It was a mistake on my part, to not research more Kobe steak restaurants, because Aoyama was a real let down. From the research, that I did, Aoyama is on the lower price range. There are reasons for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant takes reservations over Facebook Messenger. I provided 5 dates, and the response was only a 5PM dinner time was possible. We decided on Friday April 7th. To make a 5PM reservation required significant coordination in our day. We arrived the restaurant at 4:57PM. We waited outside until 5:02, then we entered. The employees inside did not invite us in. After we entered, the staff told us where to place our wet jackets, as it had been raining all day. Then we were told where to sit. We were given a menu. We asked about things other than steak. My husband is not a steak eater, but he will he eat hamburger and loves seafood. The restaurant has menus on-line. The only reason he agreed to eat here was that hamburger steak was on the menu. The order taker was very resistant to taking an order for something other than steak. At that point, we were ready to leave. I went to get our jackets and then a menu that had seafood was produced. My husband ordered a seafood plate and fried rice. I ordered the largest portion of supposedly Kobe filet, 160 grams.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 5:15, a young man enter the restaurant and he is seated at the other end of the teppanyaki table. Five minutes later a young woman joins him. We introduced ourselves, they were young newlyweds from Israel. After another 10 minutes, the mother or wife of the chef wants us to move. Supposedly a large party is coming, and they want to sit alone. Then a phone call comes in and we were told that the large party is not coming in. The chef wants us to sit all together at one end of the teppanyaki table.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chef comes out and makes a big deal of cooking garlic. I do not care for garlic on steak. Then the vegetables were cooked. Finally, the steak is cooked. Of course, beef shrinks at least 40% when cooked. The chef speaks to the newlyweds, but generally doesn’t speak to us at all, with the exception of how I would like my steak cooked. My husband’s seafood is brought out after being cooked in the kitchen. I was given a small bowl of supposedly very important rice. There was nothing special about this rice! The steak was okay. Nothing earth shattering at all. Matter of fact, the A5 Wagyu steak we had on our ANA First class flights was overwhelmingly, a better meal. My husband’s seafood was 3 medium shrimp and 3 small scallops. He said they were fine. He ordered fried rice as a side and that was cooked on the grill. That was the only item of a decent size. Everything was offered in small portions. Usually in a restaurant serving Kobe steak, the steak portion is small, and the sides are larger to make up the volume for the meal. Everything here is a small portion. The dessert, which was part of my meal, I gave to my husband. It was a 1” square of cheesecake and a tablespoon of sorbet. I tasted the sorbet; it was yuzu flavored. But it was insultingly small!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have NEVER been so disappointed with a meal! This is not fine dining. This is a Benihana style restaurant portraying itself as something that it is not! This restaurant is a small, hole-in-the-wall, mom and pop operation. As such, we expected better! It appears to cater to regulars, but I really wonder if the regulars are foreigners. They seem to only allow unknown customers to reserve at 5PM. I question if we were really served Kobe beef because the restaurant DOES NOT display the unique barcodes that come with the meat from the slaughterhouse. Aoyama is not on the list of restaurants from Kobe Meat Distribution Council which is the organization that controls and markets Kobe beef. If a restaurant is serving Kobe beef, they want to brag about it and prove it! \n",
      "\n",
      "I also used the rest room after the meal. It was not up to Japanese standards. If I used the rest room before sitting down to dinner, I definitely would have left! I have seen worse in my travels, but it was disturbing to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are a gay couple. We definitely received a cold reception after walking into the restaurant. It was plainly clear to me. Which is very odd in Japan. The Japanese whether they are accepting or not, of LGBT people, will generally treat everyone the same. Maybe this is why the chef never spoke to us. For that matter, no male in the restaurant ever spoke to us. This treatment alone, makes me rate businesses lower, but I gave Aoyama a break here. Because the ‘chef’s wife’ did speak to us, but in a very stand-offish way.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, I cannot recommend eating at Aoyama. The service was not 5 stars. The steak is questionable in origin. I was expecting a meal of a lifetime. Instead, we left the restaurant deflated and disappointed. There are many Kobe steak restaurants in Kobe, Japan. I suggest you try another restaurant.\n",

      "text: Had not heard of this place and because I was born in Italy and have always done all my own baking, I was not really looking for a bakery.  A friend told me about this bakery that supposedly baked French pastries, and because I had been to France and tasted pastries to die for, my tastebuds got working so I decided to give it a shot.  WOW!!!   Everything looked incredible:  pastries filled with custard and fresh fruit, tarts with fresh fruit and cream cheese or almond paste.  I could not decide which to try so I ordered 7 to go.  Everything I have eaten was beyond excellent and delicious, if you can believe that!  The fillings tasted very creamy and light and nothing was so \"sugary\" that you felt sick afterwards-----no, just exquisite tastes that made me reminisce of what I ate in Italy and France.  CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU TO THE CHEF for offering the American public something truly out of this world.  I have passed my experience on to my friends who all plan to go and see what I'm talking about.  I will definitely return to sample more of your outstanding goods.  By the way, if you want to have lunch, they also had some nice-looking quiches that I plan to try the next time I go.  One suggestion:  Go early because I got there at 12:30 and a lot of the trays were already empty.\n",

So, it is the home of about 23,000 nomads who are living in buffer zones. In antiquity, this area was inhabited by the Alarodians and Caspian tribes. Later, it was alternately part of the Medes and Persia. Economic activities in Arasbaran biosphere reserve are mainly agriculture, animal husbandry, horticulture, apiculture, handicrafts and tourism.\n",

We were told to wait to be seated and were told that the delay will be around 20 minutes. However by the time we could be seated it was already 35 minutes and 1500 hrs. Since I was with relatives who were visiting Goa for the first time, I wanted to order the famous Goan Fish Thali. Initially the waiter explained that they have run out of thali meals, but when we told him that we were waiting for 35 minutes for the meal and it was already 1510, he said he will talk to the manager and see what can be done. Finally after 15 minutes we were served the Thali. We were six persons and some of the accompaniments were different in different thalis, I believed they had run out of the items and replaced them with some other items. We did not mind. The food was delicious and made up more than for our wait. The fried fish was king fish and it was very fresh and nicely done, it was amazing. The clam with coconut was also exemplary and the prawn curry was also very good. In fact the entire accompaniment was very tasty. It is one of the best, or rather the best thali I have had in Goa. The seating is good and comfortable and the waiters were very helpful and efficient. The service and the food is is definitely the USP of this wonderful stand alone restaurant. It is located slightly off the CHOGM road but there are ample road sign for directions. \n",

Absolutely sublime mastery of his craft in a place that seats a dozen (maybe), open 4 hrs part of the week, and generally no take out.  Reservations recommended a month in advance.  I play by the rules and get in line often.  I've lost count of our visits but all have been orgasmically memorable.   I always go omakase and let the master choose... and then add.  For those of us fond of uni (sea urchin)... wowza... always literally ice cream of the ocean 😘.  Beyond sampling mine, my wife went with a smattering of rolls too, and tea.  I hit up the Karakuchi and Honjozo sakes this time around with unagi (fresh water eel) for desserty sweetness.  Paired well with the unago (salt water eel) that came with the omakase, too... rolled out.\n",

I made the reservation with Open Table and there was a section on the reservation for (is this a special occasion). I said we were celebrating her birthday and would it be possible to have some flowers on the table (I saw in several photos where rose peddles had been placed in a heart so I knew this was possible). All my contact information was given so I was easy to get ahold of me. When we arrived there was very little signage and we were a bit confused as how to get up to the restaurant. Even after we found the elevator, there was no information as to what floor the restaurant was on. We arrived on time but had to wait because our table was not ready ( I thought maybe they are putting the flowers out). The hostess did NOT take the opportunity to say Happy Birthday even though I had let them know that's why we were there in our reservation. We waited for our table for about 10 minutes not because there were no tables available, and a couple that arrived after us were seated first. When we were seated, the views were spectacular. The first thing I noticed was that we were seated at a table for 4 when there were just 2 of us. I would have thought since they knew the number of people in our party and that we had to wait for out table that the extra settings would have been removed before we sat down. The tables were set with chargers and a paper napkin with no flowers. The table cloths were vinyl and the corner cutting was very apparent. This is supposed to be a elegant, up class restaurant. I would have expected there to at least be linen napkins and table cloths. The food was mediocre at best and over priced. The views were spectacular.

The service was great, the food was excellent and the view from the window continues to be awesome seeing the Always Majestic Mexico City. The only thing we noticed is that this time the portion of the dish we normally order there was much smaller. We regularly ask for lobster to thermidor but it was almost half of the meat we usually get served. However, nowadays with the inflation the portions are more limited and the prices are higher where ever you go to eat, it has become part of the new life style.

      "text: I went to Stella’s with a group of ten to celebrate my friend’s upcoming wedding. My friend is severely allergic to gluten and because of this, her godmother, the party’s organizer, had spent countless hours creating a gluten free menu and communicating with the chefs and the managers to ensure that no food containing gluten would be set on the table. The appetizer course went off without a hitch and the brunch seemed to be going well. However, Several people at the table had ordered a gluten free shrimp scampi dish, one of which was the bride, the person deathly allergic to gluten. She noticed something was off with the consistency of the pasta, something she’s gotten good at after only cooking and eating gluten free foods for years. The chef confirmed that they did in fact give her regular pasta, and while they immediately remade the dish, she was already having a small reaction (a large reaction would lead to hospitalization or death) and could not continue eating. \n",
      "Then, when the desserts were brought out, they also had a waffle cone garnish which contains gluten yet again. \n",
      "My friend, the bride, then had a conversation with the manager about the two incidents in which the manager implied that she could not watch the kitchen at all times therefore it is no one’s fault that my friend was given gluten, and that we would just have to deal with it. After several minutes of back and forth arguing, the manager relented slightly and reluctantly gave the party the two pasta dishes for free and the desserts half off. The manager maintained that she and the restaurant were not at fault for giving my friend something that could kill her all while assuring that it was gluten free and reiterated several times that it was my friend who was ultimately at fault.

Its clean, simple and basic.\n",

All were tasty and good. If you are visiting Paris and like and like to taste Mauritian cooking then visit this place. the prices are reasonable, but its closed on Sundays. If your fed up of drinking coffee every in Paris instead of tea, its probably the only place in Paris where a Mauritian can get a decent cup of Mauritian tea, just like mama used to make back on the island.\n",

      "text: This isn't your Rock 'N Roll McDonald's anymore. And, frankly, as an 80-year-old retiree, I like what I see at 600 North Clark Street in Chicago's River North neighborhood. It still is McDonald's flagship location in Chicago and the signature Big Mac still is the most iconic fast-food sandwich ever invented. Remember the way it was? The original 1983 building and the first design of the rebuilt 2005 structure held a rock 'n roll exhibit in a building adjacent to the restaurant and a small upstairs McDonald's museum display. In 2017, a redesign of the restaurant and adjacent building jettisoned the rock 'n roll theme that highlighted the busiest McDonald's in the United States. In 2018, the current futuristic new building opened with 19,000 square feet on a single floor, 5,000 fewer square feet than the previous two-story structure. But it is open 24/7 and still occupies an entire city block bounded by West Ontario to the north, West Ohio to the south, North La Salle to the west and North Clark to the east. It is part of McDonald's \"Experience of the Future\" campaign, a way the company is redefining its brand across the globe with a green concept that features over 1,000 solar panels, apple trees, arugula, broccoli and kale and native grasses on the green roof. The futuristic building is a mixture of glass and steel, a dining room with a 27-foot ceiling, two 60-foot arches, a coffee bar designed to compete with Starbucks, two stories of windows, 10 cash registers and a plaza of 70 trees surrounding the restaurant. There are fewer parking spaces but more room for bicycles. Call if pedestrian friendly. Meanwhile, nobody has messed with the menu. Who could re-make a Big Mac? Who would try? In case you have forgotten, Big Mac was introduced in 1967, 10 years after Burger King's Whopper, but it is the gold standard of the fast-food industry. It contains two 100 percent pure beef patties and Big Mac's special sauce sandwiched between a sesame seed bun topped with pickles, shredded lettuce, chopped onions and American cheese. I also favor the quarter-pounder with cheese, a quarter-pound of fresh beef topped with slivered onions, tangy pickles and two slices of melted American cheese on a sesame seed bun. And the filet-o-fish sandwich with melted American cheese and topped with creamy McDonald's tartar sauce on a soft, steamed bun. Meanwhile, my wife prefers the simple but classic cheeseburger with a slab of pure beef topped with pickles, chopped onions, ketchup, mustard and a slice of American cheese. With McDonald's world famous fries made with premium potatoes such as Russet Burbank and Shepody. Wash it all down with chocolate and strawberry milk shakes. While some things change, other things don't.\n",

      "- NOT the CLASSIC ROCK N' ROLL MCDONALD'S, it is now just a very modern glass building that takes over the entire block. It misses the classic old McDonald's mood\n",
      "- NO ONE greets you as you walk in (probably only a homeless in the tables close to the entrance)\n",
      "- I expected a nice venue store inside with McDonald's merchandise... The only thing I found was a small counter with just a few items and some others displayed on the wall. NO ONE was there in case you wanted to buy something (Actually don't even know if you could buy this merchandise at all though, or if it was just the display)\n",
      "- As we walked to the cashiers to place our order we noticed a REALLY STRONG STINKY SMELL OF URINE. The smell was so strong, that we ended up leaving the place without ordering. Not sure what was the reason of it, but I found this totally unacceptable in McDonald's standards\n",
      "- I read so much about this specific Flagship location, that I expected a unique en memorable experience.. I did not find any newness in the menu, any fun in the time we remained inside the store...  \n",
      "- I would NOT RECOMMEND this McDonald's any more than any other McDonald's, but don't stop going if it's in your bucket list, make your own expectation of it, and evaluate what you find VS what you expected. If you end up going, I hope your experience is better than mine.\n",

The dirt of the actual trains, the seats, floors etc.  The rubbish on platforms and lifts was disgusting and the constant smell of urine, faeces and cannabis was unbelievable. Lots of the stations are not disabled friendly so had have my wheelchair carried up and down flights of stairs. People were standing injecting and sharing needles openly.

In hindsight, should have asked them to pour with our last serving, but perhaps they expected us to order more?\n",

However, after seeing a couple of other beach clubs on the day before I must stay that Club 55 does stand out and is one of the best places around. Food was also good. It was obvious though that they are taking advantage of their name as they placed chairs wherever they possibly could. Feels a bit overpacked and vibe and atmosphere suffer as a result.

The Bucket of Bubbly mimosa deal is well worth the money if you plan on having those as it comes with 6 miniature bottles of champagne and 2 carafes full of juice choices. The heated deck is lovely to sit on when the weather is nice and there is a guitar and microphone available to use for open mic at all times. All you have to do is turn down the mp3 player. There is also trivia available to play on the tables and games inside to use as well which is awesome. The chicken and waffle club was fantastically flavorful. Will go there again.\n",

Yet again it is a wonderful and different experience for all the family to see lots of various animals safely from your car. Unlike 2019, you are not permitted to feed the animals. There are rangers at various stages of your drive. Half way around there is a picinic area to relax and refresh for the latter part of the experience. We could not believe that there were so many black bears in the park.  We really enjoyed the Dolphin Show, even if we did get wet! It is very well laid out and animals look very well cared for.

Luckily, they had room for us even though we did not have a reservation. The menu was classic Korean with a range of barbecue, bulgogi, soups, and dumplings. We ordered the pork and spicy pork barbecue, which was served with rice and banchan. Everything was absolutely delicious, and comparable to the Korean barbecue we ate in Seoul this past March. The only thing I missed was being able to cook our meat at the table - it is served cooked on a platter from the kitchen. Highly recommended! \n",

Having lived in London for almost 30  years, it’s quite embarrassing to admit that we had never managed to do more than admired it from a distance. I’m not exaggerating when I say the visit was one of the highlights of 2022 for me and I’d love to go back sometime. Although we weren’t able to see Hunt’s ‘The Light of the World’ on our visit, there was much art to discover; the audio guides were useful for it. We were lucky to hear the choir practice which added to the special atmosphere. The climb up to the highest viewing level was a little bit challenging for my dad because of his age and for me because I don’t like heights but it was totally worth it as you can see from the pics!

Food was good, hot, and plentiful enough that we even took home a doggy bag! Good food; good service; reasonably priced.\n",

It is indeed the only tourist place to stay near Touba, and because it is outside the religious city's limits, there seemed no problem taking cigarettes or alcohol there.  The lodge is comfortable enough, with rooms arranged in comfortable, air-conditioned rondavels with private bathroom around leafy patios and pathways.  They can arrange all the usual things one equates with a tourist lodge, including drinks, meals, transport, and a taxi and guide to visit Touba's Great Mosque, itself very much worth to my mind the trip out there.  Whilst not terrible, I didn't feel too much of a welcome vibe there, and everything I requested just felt like that little bit too much of an effort for the staff.  Nevertheless, it was agreeable and the room was comfortable.  An interesting experience overall.\n",

The place is perfectly fine, well above average for a hotel in a remote African town that gets few foreign visitors. The staff are surly and unresponsive, but, I mean, we're not on a Caribbean cruise. There are no smiles and little warmth, but they feed you and bring you water when you ask. I don't expect to be fawned over at such places. \n",

      "text: If you want to visit the Senegalese town of Touba, a pilgrimage destination for members of the Islamic Mouride brotherhood, this is the place to stay.  Touba offers no hotels, only guesthouses for members of the brotherhood.  Mbacke, maybe five miles away, is the closest place offering accommodation and the Le Baol Campement is it.  One well-known guidebook describes Le Baol as \"Spartan but adequate\" and that is a good description when the electricity is on.  You wouldn't be in this part of Senegal if you weren't willing to endure at least some small amount of discomfort, so Le Baol is a good place to stay within this context.  When the electricity went off, and the a/c with it, about 8:00PM I reminded myself that I did this to myself when I decided to spend two nights in the environs of Touba, where I went to photograph the mosques and other points of interest.  Le Baol is a series of round concrete-block bungalows, much better than if all the rooms had been placed in a conventional concrete block building.  Inside had one tiny long-life bulb above the door.  An empty light socket above the bed suggests a lack of management attention, or an unwillingness to spend on anything not essential to keeping the place open.  Used soap from a previous visitor remained in the soap dish.  Two holes in the towel.  No hot water in the sink or shower, but for much of the year that won't matter since the water that comes from the tanks is not cold.  Toilet worked.  Big ants on the floor of the bathroom, but they stayed in their place. Light switches in the room have probably never been cleaned.  The bar/restaurant area pretends to have an internet connection; did not work for me.  Dinner (chicken and fries) was good; morning continental breakfast was adequate, with all the French bread you could eat and a few condiments.  Price very reasonable.  Staff not overly energetic, but seemingly glad to have my business.  Unless you want to camp out, this is the place to stay in this part of Senegal.\n",

My first experience was enjoyable but nothing earth shattering. Couple of days later, returned and bought food to go. I ordered a vegetable dish and the hot and sour seafood soup. The soup came in a large container and I was wondering how I was going to finish it on my own? Well, it didn't take much since 90% was soup and the other 10% (I'm being generous) consisted of 3 shrimp, 5 tiny little clams, 3 little pieces of squid and the rest were chunks of ginger, whole garlic, lemongrass, quarter-bits of straw mushrooms and tons of tomatoes. Again, salty as hell.  When I say \"little\" clams, I mean little clams having baby clams. It was that tiny, and just think I got a whole 5 pieces. The soup cost $350NT.  Not returning.\n",

      "text: My husband and I decided to take a chance and eat at the Old School Diner.  From the reviews, it looked like it was to be a gem of a dive and we were excited to give it a try.  I will give it an \"A\" for atmosphere but that is as far as it goes.  First off, the prices are quite high so I expected quality food.  That was not that case as I ordered Grouper that was grilled however the seasoning used was very salty-leaving the fish (which I would be surprised if that was Grouper I was served) inedible.  The side was potato salad, which I was told was good.  It tasted like the potato salad from Walmart or the grocery store-it was not homemade and it was not good.  My husband ordered a platter (fried) and it was subpar. Fries that came with the plate were definitely frozen and the platter had small servings of shrimp and oysters.  Hushpuppies were nothing special and all in all, the meal just was not good at all.  I feel like the glory days of this place has long passed it by and quality and good food are no longer on the menu.   Such a shame as we really wanted to like this place.  For our meal, which we had 2 beers and the above-came to over $120.00-which does not include the tip.  For whatever reason, they have signs stating they will take a credit card but you have to leave a cash tip.  Felt really sorry for the ladies in there working their tail off to serve this subpar food and then WILL NOT get a tip if you don't leave cash.   We definitely will NOT be back and I don't recommend eating here unless you want to spend a lot of money for low quality food.  Pretty sure they only fool the tourist and not the locals...\n",

After an hour we were sat at a dirty table.   It took them 20 minutes before we asked for help again to get the table wiped off.  We ordered the wheel chair platter for 4 and a cheeseburger plate.  It took another 45 minutes to get our food. They shorted us side dishes. They ran out of potatoes, ran out of mac-n-cheese, gave us tiny servings of potatoes salad, and the meat looked like it was just anything random in the kitchen. We had a singular pork chop, some ribs, fried mystery fish, fried shrimp, fried sweet potatoe logs (that was subbed w/o talking to us). The batter was not seasoned at all. We literally waited over 2 hours in chaos for a fried platter of seafood that was lower quality than captain d's. Our bill was $146  and they gave us $20 off.  This entire place is a gimmic.

When we went to serve them, many seemed to be older and dried out,like the sat around for a while and the others were plump and juicy, truly noticeable  when it's mixed in the same order.

      "text: Having booked the sister “boutique” hotel approx 9 mths before travelling, we were informed 3 days before departure that our hotel was “closed” and we had to move to this “marinha” hotel.  It transpires the “boutique” hotel was booked exclusively for a group! Sadly no one bothered to tell us before it was too late to make alternative plans which was very underhand by the management. We were given a lower quality of accommodation and had to use the facilities at the “marinha” hotel - a 10 minute walk away. The “marinha” is a bland corporate / golfing hotel with one pool and not a resort as we had originally booked. We could not access room service from our reallocated accommodation and it was 10 mins to the pool and nearest restaurant. The room was cleaned once, toilets did not work properly and had to be fixed and all showers leaked. Restaurants were over priced and food uninspiring. No one apologised to us once even when I went to express my concern to the management about our treatment. On the plus side staff were lovely - it’s the greedy management that has let this hotel down and contributed to a sadly disappointing holiday for us. Shame on you!\n",

      "text: This is a great hotel and golf course for some engaging golf days with family or friends. The hotel deserves its 5-star rating with good location at the course and training facilities. It has very helpful and friendly staff, spa&pool, nice big rooms, and a couple of really good restaurants. The golf course is in my view under-rated, very engaging and fun (I have played for 50+ years across Europe and US). The old Trend Jones got famous for  good reasons, and the courses challenges kept us engaged for 4 days here. It is a very strategic layout, and you really have to think your way around the pine trees to get a low score, but there are plenty of tempting doglegs and scoring opportunities out there, and we would love to come back and try again ;-) - The critic in some reviews about the need 2 times to cross fairways to get to the next tee is not an issue when you experience the attractive course. And it was very well maintained this week.\n",

Biggest example was when we found a piece of plastic wrap in the food (not a big deal) but the server never apologized, instead saying \"well, at least it wasn't hair\".  Overall food was excellent, including the $60 Elk dish which was a generous portion and very tasty, definitely worth it. Small critiques about the food: arugula placed on top of the vegan pasta was old and rotten, and both the tartar's (bison and tuna) needed more seasoning, and were served extremely cold, which was not ideal for the palette, and should be served closer to room temperature in my opinion. Also, serving fries with a $40 tartare  dish was a bit strange, maybe some roasted potatoes or a salad would be better.\n",

Maria was especially helpful when our flight was delayed, she ensured we had a ride to the hotel and that there was someone to greet and help us with our bags (hotel is down some cobble steps away from the street) when we arrived after midnight. Breakfast was plentiful and the fridge was always stocked with white wine and water since tap water wasn’t potable. We very much enjoyed our stay and would stay at Asma again if and when we return to Santorini!\n",

They sell out fast or you will get a house tour five hours after you show up.  Meaning you have to sit and wait.  Once in the tour they prioritize vip tours so you will wait on a sidewalk for 45 minutes while the higher price tours go through.  Once you get to the museums there are very few employees so any purchase will take you another hour in line.  I think the whole place takes advantage of fans. Really disappointed.\n",

They provided for all three of our needs!  The bartender gave us two glasses of a very nice French white, as requested.  And when we told them we needed another suggestion, they recommended a nice place around the corner.  The small crowd of locals was very friendly and helpful.  We of course returned for a digestif after dinner, and it was even more fun then!  We had such a good time talking to the bartender and the patrons I wish it was closer to home!  The prices were very reasonable, it was very clean and friendly too.\n",

Since her recommendation for the wine was so on point, I asked for her recommendation of food.  Again she hit it out of the park!  We had the most amazing pot of deliciousness. It was baked and steamed sauerkraut with sausage, bacon, pork tail, and potatoes.   I ate like it was going to be my last meal!  It was one of the best dishes I have ever had.

I ordered veal kidneys, these were almost raw (bloody inside and very chewy). I requested them to be re-cooked and five minutes later, I received kidneys that were cooked on the outside but still raw inside. When confronting the waiter for the bill, the waiter informed me that I would have to pay the bill because the manager was not in (an is never in except for mornings). As such, if I would like to retrieve my 20 CHF spent on chips and sauce, I will have to return to the restaurant in the morning (after 9 am) in order to be reimbursed (if this will at all be the case). Not only do I not recommend this horrid restaurant but I wish that it will shut down so that a more competent restaurateur can take its place.

I would recommend a city facing room as we were situated facing the courtyard and the rain was very noisy bouncing off the conservatory. Rooms clean and attractive. Breakfast was delicious, good quality and plenty of continental choice. Free hot drinks all day in the lobby and a free evening glass of wine between 630-730.

      "text: This isn't your Rock 'N Roll McDonald's anymore. And, frankly, as an 80-year-old retiree, I like what I see at 600 North Clark Street in Chicago's River North neighborhood. It still is McDonald's flagship location in Chicago and the signature Big Mac still is the most iconic fast-food sandwich ever invented. Remember the way it was? The original 1983 building and the first design of the rebuilt 2005 structure held a rock 'n roll exhibit in a building adjacent to the restaurant and a small upstairs McDonald's museum display. In 2017, a redesign of the restaurant and adjacent building jettisoned the rock 'n roll theme that highlighted the busiest McDonald's in the United States. In 2018, the current futuristic new building opened with 19,000 square feet on a single floor, 5,000 fewer square feet than the previous two-story structure. But it is open 24/7 and still occupies an entire city block bounded by West Ontario to the north, West Ohio to the south, North La Salle to the west and North Clark to the east. It is part of McDonald's \"Experience of the Future\" campaign, a way the company is redefining its brand across the globe with a green concept that features over 1,000 solar panels, apple trees, arugula, broccoli and kale and native grasses on the green roof. The futuristic building is a mixture of glass and steel, a dining room with a 27-foot ceiling, two 60-foot arches, a coffee bar designed to compete with Starbucks, two stories of windows, 10 cash registers and a plaza of 70 trees surrounding the restaurant. There are fewer parking spaces but more room for bicycles. Call if pedestrian friendly. Meanwhile, nobody has messed with the menu. Who could re-make a Big Mac? Who would try? In case you have forgotten, Big Mac was introduced in 1967, 10 years after Burger King's Whopper, but it is the gold standard of the fast-food industry. It contains two 100 percent pure beef patties and Big Mac's special sauce sandwiched between a sesame seed bun topped with pickles, shredded lettuce, chopped onions and American cheese. I also favor the quarter-pounder with cheese, a quarter-pound of fresh beef topped with slivered onions, tangy pickles and two slices of melted American cheese on a sesame seed bun. And the filet-o-fish sandwich with melted American cheese and topped with creamy McDonald's tartar sauce on a soft, steamed bun. Meanwhile, my wife prefers the simple but classic cheeseburger with a slab of pure beef topped with pickles, chopped onions, ketchup, mustard and a slice of American cheese. With McDonald's world famous fries made with premium potatoes such as Russet Burbank and Shepody. Wash it all down with chocolate and strawberry milk shakes. While some things change, other things don't.\n",

      "- NOT the CLASSIC ROCK N' ROLL MCDONALD'S, it is now just a very modern glass building that takes over the entire block. It misses the classic old McDonald's mood\n",
      "- NO ONE greets you as you walk in (probably only a homeless in the tables close to the entrance)\n",
      "- I expected a nice venue store inside with McDonald's merchandise... The only thing I found was a small counter with just a few items and some others displayed on the wall. NO ONE was there in case you wanted to buy something (Actually don't even know if you could buy this merchandise at all though, or if it was just the display)\n",
      "- As we walked to the cashiers to place our order we noticed a REALLY STRONG STINKY SMELL OF URINE. The smell was so strong, that we ended up leaving the place without ordering. Not sure what was the reason of it, but I found this totally unacceptable in McDonald's standards\n",
      "- I read so much about this specific Flagship location, that I expected a unique en memorable experience.. I did not find any newness in the menu, any fun in the time we remained inside the store...  \n",
      "- I would NOT RECOMMEND this McDonald's any more than any other McDonald's, but don't stop going if it's in your bucket list, make your own expectation of it, and evaluate what you find VS what you expected. If you end up going, I hope your experience is better than mine.\n",

The dirt of the actual trains, the seats, floors etc.  The rubbish on platforms and lifts was disgusting and the constant smell of urine, faeces and cannabis was unbelievable. Lots of the stations are not disabled friendly so had have my wheelchair carried up and down flights of stairs. People were standing injecting and sharing needles openly. Given the number of stations that had NYPD presence, I was shocked by the open drug use. I would not recommend this as a means of travel if you have children with you as the sites we saw of people injecting, urinating etc was an eye opener.\n",

      "text: Sitting right outside St. Martin’s Church, L’ Amandine is a large brasserie with plenty of seating inside and out. As other writers have shared, the service is fast. Many appeared to be there for drinks and dessert. If you’re looking for something other than pizza and flammekueche (tarte flambée) you might be limited in choices. Regrettably an online menu can’t be found so I’ll do my best to describe the dishes. The house specialty pork with bone plate is large. If you like spiral cut ham, you’ll like this plate. French fries accompany (which are excellent). The house specialty sausage plate is essentially the French/German version of Kielbasa over a large mound of sauerkraut (which is excellent). The house specialty salmon is similar in that it is served over sauerkraut and is smothered with a tasty sauce. The chicken with vegetables and fries was a bit dry; would try it again if accompanied with a sauce like what was on the salmon.\n",

We knew we were in the right place as soon as the waiter brought the chicken pate that accompanies the wonderfully fresh bread.  We completely enjoyed each of the dishes that we ordered -- i.e.,  the Soup de Poisson and Baked Onion Tart starters and the Duck Breast and Calamari Steak main courses, although we were disappointed that the kitchen was out of the Braised Sweetbreads.\n",

      "As good as the food was, the meal did start off with some condescending service from our waiter, who: (1) repeatedly volunteered painstaking explanations of basic French terms on the menu for which we required and did not request any explanation; and (2)  when returning to report that they were out of the Cote Du Rhone that we'd ordered, proposed that we instead order a bottle of St Emilion, which he described as not as bold as a \"Bordeaux\" -- an odd and incorrect description, since St Emilion is one of the classic wines of the Bordeaux wine region.  \n",

Frizee salad with oozing poached egg and fried lardons nicely dressed.  Husband had the Veal picatta over angel hair.  Very light dish.  My beef bourgiguon ultra rich.  Sadly too large a portion for one.  Did not save room for dessert, but tarte tartan, creme brulee and profiteroles were among offerings.  Old fashioneds at the start were well made.

The quality of the meat was excellent, especially  the T-bone steak and the \"brochette gourmande\". The price was a bit too high considering that we had a paper tablecloth and paper napkins.

Don’t take my order, only to return 10 minutes later and bluntly say ”The kitchen says they do not have potato chips” Rather come and say sorry we don’t have chips but we can offer you …… in its place. Our waiter disappeared like the mist and we had to order a round of drinks from another waiter. Then my food is bought to the table almost 5 minutes before my wife’s food. Surely the kitchen can pair the 2 meals seeing we were only 2 people at the table. As expected, our empty plates had to be removed by another waiter as ours was MIA. I had to wait 10 minutes after asking for the bill for him to bring it. This at 09h00 in the morning when they were not even busy!\n",

Breakfast was delicious, good quality and plenty of continental choice. Free hot drinks all day in the lobby and a free evening glass of wine between 630-730.

Upon arriving at the door, we were pleasantly greeted and seated immediately.  The buffet was offered to us but we declined thinking buffets are typically not great.  My husband and teen daughter went to check it out while we waited on drinks and decided it was indeed good value as the items on the buffet were the same ones they were going to order à la carte for more $$.  Our server Lyanka could not have been more efficient!  Excellent service.  I must note that I chose to order off the menu and had the Verrière Club.  It was the best club I have ever had!  Crispy bacon and tons of sliced up chicken breast, pomme frites like I have had in France.  Excellent meal and great value.\n",

Health and safety is not on the hotel priority list clearly. Twice! So obviously a daily routine. The beach was like a war zone. The hotel was under heavy construction and we were woken Daily at 8am by construction equipment and workers staring at us as we sat on our balconies. We watched one van reverse and complexly take out a lamppost and just drive off. Pics will be attached.  Nothing was open  Apart from 1 pool bar, freezing pools, no slides as they were being repaired.  The inside pool was so filthy with mouldy voils, ants nests and again fag end and empty bottles to the entrance. \n",

The flies were basically rolling around and dancing in the uncovered food. We spent alot of time on the toilet, nursing a bad bellyache. Some of the staff were fairly friendly some of the others wasnt as much. The guests were extremley arragont, rude and stare at you like your not from the same planet, making it quite obvious they're talking about you as they snigger and laugh. Basically making you feel uncomfortable, we couldn't wait to leave! I know I can't blame the hotel for guests but it just added to the most terrible holiday experience we have ever had. We purchased a mens deodrant from 1 of the shops and later realised he'd charged an extra 6 euros for it, when we went in to complain the man had taken all the price stickers down and acted like he didn't have a clue what we was talking about. The Men (staff and customers) have no respect for women and they would stare at my breasts even when they knew I could see them doing it they would just carry on, despite being covered up they still carried on to do so.

      "text: We were delighted to rediscover this intimate French restaurant.  Wife and I made reservations through Open Table for a week night and were promptly seated.  The menu was not extensive but well chosen, real French fare including escargot, coq au vin, duck confit, etc. No full bar, but a good wine list including excellent kier royale.  We were served with excellent French bread and butter without having to order it separately, which is the usual practice nowadays. Wife and I ordered their butter lettuce salad, which was very fresh, with excellent olive oil dressing with anchovies.  The escargot in potato cups and delicious green sauce was innovative and flavorful.  The coup de grace were the main courses – wife ordered the Chilean sea bass special, which was outstandingly flavorful and cooked just right, as was the rack of lamb I ordered, rare as I wanted, with an outstanding flavorful wine sauce.  The accompanying vegetables and potatoes were also tasty and we cleaned our rather sumptuous plates.  For dessert, we ordered the floating island, which we love but have not found on the menu in any other French restaurant so far.  The islands puff pastries floated in wonderful creamy sauce before vanishing into our appreciative mouths.  The service was attentive, friendly, and professional.  Overall, a wonderful authentic French bistro, which we intend to frequent.\n",

We had just ordered pizza and I asked about other menu items and if there was anything he suggested. He suggested the fries - they put cheeze curds and gravy (on the side).

All the dishes were made from scratch and are freshly cooked. The mix of aromas and tastes was delightful. The restaurant is worth stepping out of the canal pathway (avoid the 40 tourists-trap restaurants there, ok, maybe 35 of the 40 available) and enjoy food that are inspired by the South of France and some other parts of the world.

      "text: I went with my daughter, who is an adventuresome eater. (In Poland, Thai food counts as adventuresome.) We had the salt/pepper squid to start, then a vegetable pad thai and halibut with chilli, garlic and lemon. After that my daughter had mango sorbet. The food was tasty but the kitchen was overly cautious about seasoning. For example, on the menu it said the holibut would be very spicy. It was very bland, watery in fact, and very slightly overcooked (it just fell apart and was therefore difficult to eat with chopsticks. The lack of spiciness is a fairly common problem in Poland, where people are not used to especially spicy foods, so that ethnic restaurants frequently tone things down for the locals. (This is always true in Indian restaurants, for example.) On the whole, the food was good though not great. Service was brisk, cheerful, and helpful, but a bit rushed...even though we ate early and the restaurant was only about 20% occupied while we were there. The pad thai was the best I've had in Poland, but it was also roughly twice the price of similar dishes elsewhere. Wines are also overpriced. I had a glass of ordinary Veneto pinot grigio for 28zł -- about 40% more than it might have been elsewhere. We sat near the open kitchen, which was fun for my daughter, who is 12. I'm glad I went once -- but I doubt I will return, especially as getting there involved an Uber ride, which added to the cost. I noticed a lot of English speakers around us, so perhaps this restaurant is favoured by business people on expense accounts.\n",

I can’t express how much I appreciate the fact that he made our safety more of a priority than making money. We went on Wednesday morning and had a great ride out and then snorkeled. Every time I took a quick break, his eyes were on us making sure we were okay. He was knowledgeable and friendly. Having the boat to ourselves was worth every cent. Plus it wasn’t any more expensive than the bigger boat tours who are more out for the money. Definitely would not hesitate to book with him again today if we are ever back in the area!!!\n",

Every beach in Mauritius is public and I lay down in shade in front of this property fully on the beach sand, not on his lawn. He came to me and told me to leave his ’private’ beach. I kindly told him that I’m sitting on public beach but he insisted and show me one picture And some text from newspaper in French that public beach is only where is water - tide line 😜. And told me very rude that I’m not educated enough should go to school and I don’t even speak French - only English 🧐🤪. So there were two police officers nearby and I asked them if I can stay on the beach in front of his property. They confirmed and told the rude French than he cannot behave like this because it is not private property. How such a person can even run any business? Maybe I could be his next customer....\n",

After that he helped me to buy a ticket to Sukhothai (about 310 Baht). I waited about 1 hour in the station's building , there were plenty options for shopping and feeding before riding the bus.

      "\n",
      "The views on the 6 hour ride are pretty amazing and the train stops from time to time to allow passengers the chance to alight and take photos.\n",

      "We travelled in the First Class Panoramic Car which was modern, spotlessly clean, spacious and stylish. Whilst food was available for table service, we had taken our own and, to be honest, we were glad to have done so as, by British standards, the meals and drinks available were very expensive and did not appear to be that special.\n",
      "\n",
      "The onboard team were very genial and helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest, the journey felt a little long and overly slow at times and, despite the attractive scenery, it started to feel somewhat repetitive after the first couple of hours. If you can break the journey that might be better. \n",
      "\n",
      "In our opinion, whilst the trains were less well appointed and did not offer the same silver service experience, the Bernina Express route from  Tirano to Chur was a much prettier and more impactful and interesting journey. That said, Zermatt at the end of the Glacier Express line beats Chur as a destination for charm, prettiness and interest, albeit prices for food there made the Glacier Express look cheap!\n",

      "text: Most people agree that a scenic train ride through the Swiss Alps would be both breathtaking and worthwhile, if the weather cooperates of course. The Glacier Express provided us with one of the easier options to have that experience. Since there are already thousands of posted pictures here, as well as the full range of good to bad comments, I am only uploading a few pics just to prove I actually took the trip. As for review commentary, I am providing only two observations/suggestions. First, unless you prefer to pay 6.50 CHF per plastic bottle of water, bring your own water bottles/containers. Even with purchased meals, they provide no beverages. Second, as if the basic cost of the train tickets was not pricey enough, you must pay to reserve a seat which is non-refundable unless you buy minimal-cost cancellation insurance. The advice here is to pre-reserve your seat as early as you possibly can. We were allowed to make seat reservations three months prior to our travel date. The First Class cars have two persons seated at a table on one side and four persons at a table on the other. If traveling as a couple, then it is probably more desirable to sit by yourselves. We were on the website very early on the first day we could reserve, and there were only two sets of these seats left. Although we have no proof, we suspect that tour operators/companies had been given priority to reserve their groups in advance. In any event, be forewarned, and have a really memorable journey.\n",

      "text: It's just a lifetime experience of a journey on this top grade train. We chose to board at Brig station at around 10 AM and travelled up to Chur which comes at around 230 PM. It covers the best part of its tour through innumerable number of tunnels besides a 15 minutes stop at Aldermet at 2050 metres altitude and travel amidst full snow fall and glaciers. Truly amazing experience. Booking of seats on this train was done over  4 months earlier to ensure our seats together, and even before Visa s were applied. Train ticket is covered under Eurail Pass. Must include in any Swiss tour. Recommended.\n",

      "\n",
      "The restaurant has beautiful decor with lots of wood, including live plank slabs suspended artfully on the ceiling, charcoal accents, intimate wooden tables for 2, 4 or more and a beautiful bar that accommodates seating. The ceiling and bar drape with greenery, reminding you that the food takes its cues from the forested landscape around Quebec City. You even get a very hot, cedar scent-infused hot cloth to wash your hands as the meal begins.  The ceramic plates are beautifully artistic and the stemware is refined. The restaurant is infused with soft light from, lots of blown glass balls that hang at various heights throughout the restaurant and each table has an intimate circle of light from a small table lamp. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yup. This restaurant is about the heightening and exploring the senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was absolutely beautiful with each dish looking like a work of art. Sometimes that level of artistry can sacrifice flavour, but not at Légende... each dish had wonderful balance, and intense flavours. Attention was paid to the textures as well so that each bite of my pasta (agnolotti) was different. It was incredibly delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was hesitant to order the dessert that I chose, a shiitake and hazelnut cake with mushroom caramel... mushrooms in a dessert??? But it was fabulous, being not too sweet and most definitely not tasting of mushrooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint is that you have to view the menu from your phone... something that diminishes the atmosphere of the restaurant and takes away from the intimacy of dining with a partner where the outside world cannot intrude.\n",
      "\n",
      "One other thing to note is that there has a handful of single diners who reserved seating at the bar on the evening we were there. This is a wonderful way for someone who is dining solo to immerse themselves in the dining experience while not feeling that eyes are on them, sitting alone, at a table. I wouldn't hesitate to go there solo.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also very happy to see wine from Le Vieux Pin, our favourite Okanagan winery, on the menu! It's a very small winery and its wines are very hard to come by outside of the valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last piece of advice: the tasting menu takes 2 + 1/2 to 3 hours to do... it was why we opted to go à la carte because we would be otherwise tight for time. So leave yourself ample time to really enjoy the dining experience.\n",

The menu makes choosing hard, everything was freshly cooked and local, very good indeed. My (cold) courgette soup was refreshing and flavoursome and the chicken that followed was perfectly balanced but the piece de resistance was the dessert, a delicious peach stewed in verbena/ verveine syrub with cream flavoured with thyme. The excellent wine came from a young grower with his vineyard just 500m away, one of the best and best-value wines we have tasted in local restaurants.

I had a Hummus dish with olives and seasonings that was wonderfully flavorful. My wife enjoyed a chicken dish as her main.

For wine we had a bottle of real good local Burgundian white wine of € 25 (all other bottles were more expensive). Good service, but it is a small restaurant.

The cheese on my sandwich was in small pieces, like they broke it up to spead it on the roll. The meat was sparse. Mine had turkey - 2 slices and salami - at least 3 maybe 4. I asked for onions and hot peppers too. Which was extra and schimpy.  Back to the roll. Mine was stale. It was no Amorso roll. It was breaking apart. It was tough chewing. I was very disappointed. It was my idea to go there. But, my husband had an Italian sandwich and he said his was good. So, it's really a matter of taste or type of sandwich but for me it was just average.\n",

It is a very small establishment (4 outside tables, and 4-6 SMALL inside tables - unsure about inside as we opted for out). It took quite a while to begin being served (although they had cleaned the table for us).  I ordered the almond croissant and coffee and my hubby ordered the chocolate croissant and coffee (which they were out of so he opted for almond as well). It took a while for our order to be taken. It took quite a while to receive our order (even though nothing to be cooked). She only brought coffee for me.....had to flag her down to get my husband’s coffee. She dropped off our bill when giving our croissants and MY coffee and obviously had no intention of returning or checking on us....and she didn’t! We had ordered water, never got. We tried to get second cup of coffee (even if it meant another purchase) but she never came back.  SHE was the obvious OWNER (by the way). I took our check inside to pay and SHE rang it up....didn’t look at me, didn’t ask if we enjoyed or if everything was okay...NOTHING! I’ve worked/managed  (in the past) in the restaurant business for 25+ years.....if one of my servers had given “service” in this manner, I would have fired them!\n",

      "At the day of event we were shocked that no table were reserved for us. When we checked with the manager he confirmed that he have all the correspondance but they are fully booked and cannot assist. The staff were rude and they didn't try any alternative solution. They just turned their face and left us at the entrance. They didn't offer even a sincere regret to the girl who was waiting for her birthday . I think it is the worst place to recommend to customers who are looking for a professional and warm service . That day was just a disappointment how such service is exist in 2023 .beside all this they do not accept international cards or credit cards. So neither human service nor teck one .\n",

      "Moon Palace Cancun falls short in certain areas. While the resort offers a wide range of activities and entertainment, the quality did not live up to my expectations. Despite the abundance of restaurants, none of the meals we received were served hot, which is a major disappointment for someone who considers themselves a foodie. It's possible that the resort prioritizes quantity over quality in their dining options.\n",

We knew going into it that it would be busy because of spring break so we went with an open mind. Overall, we were extremely disappointed in Moon Palace and the service. \n",

      "When checking in, they didn’t have the room we booked available but we settled and tried to not let that bother us. Things just got worse and worse after that. They start selling to you the minute you check in. They push you right to the desk for the member presentation and the vacation planners are all over you. \n",
      "We ended up agreeing to the presentation just to get 3 free day passes to the grand and $750 in resort credits. We did the tour and all that the next day. We have two children, age 12 and 7. Our 7 year old is autistic. They had us send the kids to a gaming/playroom while they put the hard sell on you. After we said no for over an hour, we finally got up and went to get our kids. Our 12 year old informed us they let our 7 year old out to the bathroom by himself and he wandered around for 20 minutes before he found his way back, luckily! \n",

      "We decided to book massages for my wife and I with our resort credit and use the remainder to go swim with dolphins. Unfortunately, the day before our massages, my son spilled pop on the slips they require you to have to get your day pass for the grand and for the massages. We went to the vacation planners to ask if they could be reprinted and they told us they could not. I asked what do we do then? They said unfortunately we would have to forfeit the massages. I said that’s fine, then just cancel them. They said they couldn’t because they needed to be cancelled 24 hours before and it was now 23 hours so it was too late. But, we still had to pay the service fee for the credits!! \n",
      "Also, the dolphin swim is an absolute ripoff when booking through there. Even with resort credits, it cost us over $360 for four people. \n",

      "I was sent a survey a few days later asking about our stay. I wrote in there about those issues and an employee, who I can’t name here, reached out within a few hours. I thought, great, someone actually cares! He came to our room and said he would get it sorted out. A few days go by and I kept checking in with him and he just said he was still working on it. Of course, it came time to check out and still no answer, but I had to pay almost $500 to leave. I tried getting in touch with the manager and no answer. I ended up talking to public relations and they said they would not do anything about it and we had to pay it all if we wanted to leave. They even said that even though it was an accident about our slips, that’s our problem and we should have been more careful. I mean, come on, kids have accidents! That’s a terrible and ridiculous thing to say and a policy to have. So, we were bullied into paying for services we didn’t get.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was not great. We have stayed at other all inclusives that the food was up to a much higher standard. The service was slow and the employees were not friendly. We did not have housekeeping for the first three days of our stay. I had to keep calling and asking for it. \n",
      "Unfortunately, it seems Palace Resorts only cares about the money and not customer service. They try selling you stuff every time you walk by a desk and they even tried selling us more as we were leaving after everything that happened. We were extremely disappointed after spending a lot of money to stay there and in the poor/non existent service by a so called manager and all public relations staff. I hope this information can help others to not make the same mistake we made by staying at Moon Palace.\n",

      "Each day we took clean towels back to our room so we could claim our spots at the pool the following morning. The towel shack does not open until 8am (I think) and by that time most of the desirable chairs are taken. Good idea to leave some personal property on the chair as well... there are some unscrupulous people who will take your seats in your absence.\n",

When you enter the restaurant and you see a woman with her hands over her ears and the noise so high that you can not hear anyone, you know there is a problem.  We love Libby’s in Sarasota and decided to try this new version.  The menu was basically the same, the food was well prepared but what good is good food when the noise level is deafening.

As I clicked pay, I realized my mistake and contacted everyone immediately but got told by the hotel, no, it’s not in their policy to change dates. It is not like I changed my mind, it was an honest mistake.  So, I left it, changed the flights, and got new hotel accommodations,  we then decided to do the trip again in March and got new flights for 24/03 and 25/03, the airline canceled our flights due to strikes in Paris, again I contacted the hotel, but they don’t care, didn't want to help or as it is not their problem.\n",

      "\n",
      "We then came back at around 9pm to check in and there was this guy who didn’t even let me finish talk and all he cared about was to secure the payment for the room. My mum put her card in the machine and, my mum doesn’t speak English, and he was shouting at her “remove, remove remove” to remove the card from the machine. I told him “my mum doesn’t speak English. There’s no need to shout at her”. after going to the room I then came back downstairs to ask for an additional pillow and an additional towel as we were only given one hand towel and one body towel. He properly got upset there starting to question me in a very rude and aggressive tone as to why I was asking for more towels, and he even wanted to come upstairs to my room to check if I was lying or not. I mean, this is just shocking and unprofessional behaviour. I have never seen anything like this in my life. I then explained him again and he went to get towels for me, without coming to my room. He went to get the towels like he had to do a massive job, you could tell that the guy just didn’t want to work and he would have been happier somewhere else. When he came back with the towels, no pillow of course, I told him he had just been rude to us since we had arrived for no reason, and that we are customers, you don’t treat people in this way. I was afraid of asking him the pillow, because of the way he treated me, I nearly cried. He then said sorry but added “and now, do not disturb”. I mean, whoever gave him the job made a terrible mistake, this person does not deserve to work if he treats people like that. \n",

      "A couple of days later I asked for a pillow at reception at another member of staff who was so nice. I told him that I had already asked for a pillow two days before to his colleague and complained about the whole thing. He said he was sorry about that and gave me a pillow, and explained that the guy who was rude was just a temp guy working at the hotel. Even if he is a temporary member of staff, it’s not a justification for him to behave in this way and treat people like trash. We are customers paying for a stay. It’s his job to answer customers requests, and answer any query they might have. Even if the hotel hires staff to cover for peak periods or for temporary roles, they need to ensure that the staff does their job correctly and treats customers in a respectful and professional way, it’s not a justification for him to behave like that because he is temporary, very disappointed about that.\n",

      "text: The hotel was really nice with great facilities like a laundry that you could pay to use. The room itself was awesome for the price. We had a top floor room with a view of the Eiffel Tower which was amazing to watch it shimmer at night. The kitchenette is great and had all the utensils you could want to prepare simple meals. The room was clean and pretty modern. The location is great you have lots of options for trains either a short walk for the RER-C line of the metro 7 line depending on where you want to go. The only real downside was that the service differed greatly depending on which receptionist you got. The young lady was amazing, super positive and friendly and seemed like she would go out of her way to help you. The other lady was fine but just not super warm. For example when I asked for another roll of toilet paper she quizzed me on how long I was staying and reluctantly handed over 1 roll which wasn't really sufficient and made we wonder if I had said less days would she have said no... There was a few minor issues like this but otherwise a great stay!\n",
